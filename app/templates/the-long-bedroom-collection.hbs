    <p>The Owl House is in Nieu Bethesda, a tiny and remote village in the Karoo. Today, it is a relatively popular South African destination &ndash; tourists regularly stream in, charmed by its quaint aesthetic and inaccessibility. Historically, the town was like other small Afrikaans villages &ndash; conservative, parochial and patriarchal. Today, it is recognised as a haven for artists and liberal-minded travellers; previously, it was anything but.</p>
    <p>Helen Martins was born in Nieu Bethesda in 1897, and after a few years away as a young adult, returned to the town in 1925 to look after her sick parents. She stayed until her death in 1976. In approximately 1945, she began transforming the house, and over the next thirty years, created a mystical dream-like world of her own. Ross (1997:58) describes the Owl House:</p>
    <p><em>It is very difficult to describe the impact made when one first approaches, and then enters, the Owl House. One of the many emotions to be registered could be shock, then disorientation and claustrophobia; it is so unexpected and unfamiliar, and so filled with sensations and objects.</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Helen recounted how she was once lying ill in bed and suddenly, with the moon shining through the window, thought how dull and <em>&lsquo;vaal&rsquo; </em>(grey) everything was, and how she would like to brighten up her life&rdquo; (Ross, 1997:58). It was an all-consuming task &ndash; Martins didn&rsquo;t just plan and create as a side project; she lived it. It was her own refusal to be dictated by the social and cultural (and artistic) restraints that allowed for the creation of what she called The Owl House.</p>
    <p>The Owl House was Martins&rsquo; creation, and her artistic expression, but it was also her home. Many of the objects in the Owl House were not practical, and moreover, many of the objects served a decorative purpose only. Decorative functions were of far more importance to Martins&rsquo; Owl House than actual function. Objects and sculptures throughout the house are linked to each other symbolically and literally; there are motifs and thematic repetitions. For example, Martins was obsessed with light, and hung mirrors throughout the house. She positioned them carefully throughout the house. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>As Emslie (1997:68) explains,</p>
    <p><em>It is perfectly in keeping with Helen&rsquo;s method of working that objects were continually shifted around&hellip;Helen was always playing with her space. One idea would lead to another. New combinations would be tried out, new juxtapositions created. The Owl House never remained the same from one week to the next. Helen had a tremendously fertile imagination and delighted in trying out new subtleties of meaning by shifting, adding or subtracting elements. This has always to be borne in mind now that the Owl House has acquired a static and posthumous quality.</em></p>
    <p>Helen Martins created a world of her own in her house in Nieu Bethesda, and The Long Bedroom Collection represents a small slice of the Owl House in its entirety. The Long Bedroom was the bedroom that Martins and her sisters slept in as children, and it continued to serve as a bedroom as Martins grew older. In other words, it was less of a space of display as other rooms in the house, which makes it an interesting composite of public and private space. As Ross (1997:72) explains:</p>
    <p><em>It seems that this was Helen&rsquo;s favourite room for sleep, and it is not difficult to see why, as it is the lightest and brightest, and faces north &ndash; probably the warmest bedroom. Windows extend down a great deal of the length of the long outside north wall, and there are also windows on the west wall&hellip;Long mauve, red, orange, yellow, and green sunfilter curtains hang in front of the northern windows, but let in light and colour. The overall impression of colour in this room is of mauve, pink, green, and yellow. The ceiling is again decorated in strong geometric designs, and the walls in bands of blocks of colour.</em></p>
    <p>The Owl House is recognised as an art environment, and today, Martins is known as an Outsider Artist. &ldquo;Outsider art and the artists that create it are fragile. The artists operate outside the accepted system and rarely have the support of like-minded people. They are often loners, in extreme cases isolated from society, and are usually viewed by others as strange or eccentric&rdquo; (Ross, 1997:255).</p>
    <p>A visit to the Owl House is an immersive experience, and importantly, it needs to be understood as an art environment. It cannot be de-contextualised; in fact, it&rsquo;s meaning lies in its site-specificity. The Owl House was an ongoing work, and without Helen Martins, it is lifeless. Dust gathers, objects decay, but the Owl House still stands. It is safe to assume that, were Martins still alive, the Owl House would have further evolved, and it would certainly not be as it is now. What remains &ndash; this last whisper of Martins and her extraordinary vision &ndash; should be understood as a possible iteration of Martins&rsquo; environment rather than a true representation of how Martins left it. The Owl House and its accompanying Camel Yard are fragile, and are not impervious to the ravages of time. Dust gathers and decay begins, and long-term survival is doubtful.</p>
