<p>Two identical wooden deer ornaments stand face to face on the windowsill to the verandah. These are an example of a very common type of tourist object. The window is obscured by its coloured glass, and Martins kept birds in a small aviary on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deer was one of Helen's minor motif's. She copied a deer logo&hellip;from the SA airways logo [elsewhere in the house]. So one of the meanings of the deer for Helen was travel to far off and exotic places, the possibility of flying off to another destination. Helen liked to cluster imagery. Not one owl but many, not one deer but a number of them around the house&rdquo; (Graaff, personal communication 2017, 27 October).</p>
