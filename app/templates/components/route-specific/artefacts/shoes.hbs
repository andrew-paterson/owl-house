<p>Many anecdotes about Martins tell how she was painfully shy about her feet as she grew older. An interview with Betty Crous (in Emslie, 1997:67) further explains: &ldquo;Helen had bunions. She was seen by an orthopaedic surgeon in Graaff-Reinet. A date was made for her to have the bunions operated upon. Six weeks later she was lying in hospital. She had already received medication when the doctor came. &lsquo;What are we to do for you today?&rsquo; he enquired. Helen replied with muzzy humour, &lsquo;Oh you are going to cut off my toes.&rsquo; He did.&rdquo; After the accidental amputation, none of her shoes would fit, and Martins resorted to wearing flip-flops, Crous recalls. However, Martins still kept her fashionable shoes, or what she referred to as &lsquo;winkle-pickers&rsquo; (Emslie, 1997: 67). These are an example &ndash; they have pointed toes that squeeze the feet.</p>
