<p>The lamp was made in Hong Kong. There are three identical lamps in the house (two more in the kitchen). It is missing its lamp wick holder, and was instead used as a candle holder.</p>
<p>Martens was obsessed with light &ndash; &ldquo;she created it in the most ingenious and novel ways. Apart from the light-reflecting, glass-encrusted surfaces everywhere, she had large mirrors specially cut to her designs&hellip;hung in every room at strategic and obviously well-thought-out points. They reflected room to room, light to light, image to image, moon and sunshin to other points, and when her multitude of candles and lamps were lit, must have increased the light a thousandfold&rdquo; (Ross, 1997:58).</p>
<p>Her &ldquo;collection of varied and multi-coloured paraffin lamps of all sizes fills two wall cupboards. To have visited Helen at night when she lit up her house must have been a remarkable experience.&rdquo; (Ross, 1997: 59).</p>
<p>According to sources, it took Martens three hours to light up all of her candles and lamps on special occasions, like visits from friends (Ross, 1997:59). &ldquo;It was stunning &ndash; it was like a child&rsquo;s fairyland &ndash; unbelievable. Lighting up the place was a joyous experience of sharing rather than that of a depressive trying to escape darkness&rdquo; (interview with Jill Wenman, in Ross, 1997:60).</p>
