<p>Made from a glass bottle and cement, these &lsquo;<em>meisies</em>&rsquo; are one of Martins&rsquo; most replicated creations, both in the Owl House and in the Camel Yard. There are many hostesses throughout the house, and many more larger ones in the Camel Yard. &ldquo;Indoors, they function as cement candle holders. They are displayed on shelves and dressing tables. They are the handmaidens of the home, providing light and assisting in the ritual of dressing&rdquo; (Emslie, 1997:73).</p>
