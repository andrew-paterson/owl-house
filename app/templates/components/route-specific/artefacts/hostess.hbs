<p>Made from a glass bottle and cement, these &lsquo;<em>meisies</em>&rsquo; are one of Martins&rsquo; most replicated creations, both in the Owl House and in the Camel Yard. There are many hostesses throughout the house, and many more larger ones in the Camel Yard. &ldquo;Indoors, they function as cement candle holders. They are displayed on shelves and dressing tables. They are the handmaidens of the home, providing light and assisting in the ritual of dressing&rdquo; (Emslie, 1997:73).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen had many of these miniature hostess figures on the dressing tables in her house. Their form was inspired by a little brass bell, in the shape of a Dutch girl, the sort of bell to summon the household to the dinner table. Helen's 'meisies' or hostesses, when on the dressing tables were, I suppose, a form of the lady in waiting. They held out jewelry and other objects for adornmen&rdquo; (Graaff, personal communication 2017, 27 October).</p>
