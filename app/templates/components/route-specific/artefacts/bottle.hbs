<p>Martens collected bottles and &ldquo;glass of all colours from wherever she could&rdquo; (Ross, 1997:58). The local children in the town would bring bottles to Martens&rsquo; house knowing that they would get paid in quince sweets &ldquo;She always paid us with sweets, not with money...[w]e used to collect them in the afternoons, and from there we went to collect wood for our parents in the veld, but then we had something delicious to chew on&rdquo; (interview with Swiers, in Ross, 1997:58). There are several identical and similar bottles throughout the house. There is little ground glass of the same colour, most probably because these bottles were mostly used for medicines and were more expensive than green and brown bottles.</p>
